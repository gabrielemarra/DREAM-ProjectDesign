\subsection{Purpose}
\noindent
The purpose of this document is to provide a functional description of the design details of the DREAM product. The design details described in this document are chosen to meet the requirements and specifications outlined in the Requirements and Specification Document (RASD). This document is intended for designers in the implementation phase; the design descriptions provided outline the overall architecture of the system, offer different technical views of the system, provide more detailed user interface mock-ups, and present traceability back to the requirements from the RASD. This document also provides developers a general description of a plan to implement, integrate, and test the system.

\subsection{Scope}
\noindent
The scope of this document includes functional descriptions at the architectural level, at the component level, and at the user interface level. Then, this document also includes a section dedicated to the implementation, system integration, and test plan phases of the development process. The main scope of this document is on the design of the DREAM product which is decomposed into its different components and functions. This decomposition of the system is supported by a traceability mapping: the main artery that links the DD and RASD documents. \\
The scope of the DREAM product focuses on three main stakeholders: farmers, agronomists, and policy makers. This includes offering farmers a tool to manage their production and facilitate communication when seeking assistance; offering agronomists a tool to manage their workflows including managing their daily plans, reports, and requests for assistance; and offering policy makers a tool to easily view the data collected from the entire region to observe trends as they relate to their policies. This product is only focused on serving the Telangana region.
