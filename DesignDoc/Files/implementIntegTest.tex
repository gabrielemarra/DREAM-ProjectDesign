% Identify here the order in which you plan to implement the subcomponents of your system and the order in which you plan to integrate such subcomponents and test the integration.


\subsection{Overview}
To comply with standard design practices it is suggested to undergo unit testing as each component is built, integration testing as component get pieced together, and system testing to validate the system as a whole. This section will detail the order in which the components should be built, the method to carry out testing, and the manner in which to integrate the components.

 
\subsection{Implementation Plan}

As stated previously, the entire system can be decomposed into 15 components which shall be built in the following order: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item AuthenticationManager
\item FarmerReportManager
\item AgronomistReportManager
\item DataAggregationManager
\item StatisticsManager
\item DailyPlanManager
\item MessageManager
\item FarmManager
\item RankingManager
\item TriggerManager
\item NotificationManager
\item ForumManager
\item FarmerSuggestionManager
\item RecommenderManager
\item WeatherManager
\end{enumerate}
