%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%% THE PROBLEM %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The world's food supply chain is threatened by climate change and an unsustainable rate of rising population. Since the Telangana region largely participates in the world's food economy, the Telangana government is interested in pursuing initiatives aimed at mitigating the effect of these issues. In this case, the Telangana government wants to reform the way they build their policies around food production. Their goal is to utilize digital public goods and community-centric approaches in order to build resiliency against these dynamic challenges by building policies that are more agile and data-driven.

\subsection{Purpose}
\subsubsection{Purpose of the Document}
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive description of the requirements and specifications of the project. This includes clearly defining the problem, then specifying the expectations of the proposed solution. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the requirements and specifications of the DREAM product, the product will be described in terms of the necessary functions required and a look at how the product will serve its specific users. Then, the requirements will be detailed including the interface requirements, functional requirements, and the performance requirements. The requirements defined will be subsequently analyzed using Alloy. 

\subsubsection{Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this effort is to provide a solution to address the problem previously outlined. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%% THE PROPOSED SOLUTION %%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This initiative, named {\bf D}ata-d{\bf R}iven Pr{\bf E}dictive F{\bf A}r{\bf M}ing, or DREAM, intends to provide a solution that focuses on serving the needs of three stakeholders: farmers, agronomists, and policy makers.

\end{figure}


The general aim is to take advantage of the present-day abundance of data and potential for platforms to streamline communication. By introducing data analysis, farmers can have access to automated solutions, therefore tackling their issues with agility and confidence. Additionally, by offering a means of communication, farmers can leverage their own community as a resource for information and support. Regarding policy makers and agronomists, the product will serve as a tool to aid their respective work-flows.

%%%%%%%%%%%% THE GOALS %%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Goals}

DREAM will serve as a central tool for policy makers to access data about the region. For farmers, DREAM will serve as a tool to help them organize their own production data as well as provide an interface to seek for support from their community. Finally, agronomists will use DREAM as a tool to manage their work such as planning field visits or verifying the data provided by farmers. The following table lists an aggregate collection of the distinct goals that serve the three main stakeholders in the scope of this system.
