%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%% THE PROBLEM %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The world's food supply chain is threatened by climate change and an unsustainable rate of rising population. Since the Telangana region largely participates in the world's food economy, the Telangana government is interested in pursuing initiatives aimed at mitigating the effect of these issues. More specifically, the Telangana government aims to reform the way they build their policies related to food production. Their goal is to utilize digital public goods and community-centric approaches in order to build resiliency against these dynamic challenges by building policies that are more agile and data-driven.

%%%%%% THE PROPOSED SOLUTION %%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Purpose of the Product}
The purpose of the product is to provide a solution to address the problem previously outlined. 
This initiative, named {\bf D}ata-d{\bf R}iven Pr{\bf E}dictive F{\bf A}r{\bf M}ing, or DREAM, intends to provide a solution that focuses on serving the needs of three stakeholders: farmers, agronomists, and policy makers as shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:stakeholders}}.

\begin{flushleft}
The general aim is to take advantage of the present-day abundance of data and the potential for platforms to streamline communication. By utilizing data analysis, farmers can have access to automated solutions, therefore tackling their issues with agility and confidence. Additionally, by offering a means of communication, farmers can leverage their own community as a resource for information and support. Regarding policy makers and agronomists, the product will serve as a tool to aid their respective work-flows.

%%%%%%%%%%%% THE GOALS %%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Goals} \label{goalsection}

The DREAM system is intended to provide a solution for the many issues that arise when the food production sector is strained by slow communication and ineffective policies. Regarding the utility for farmers, purpose of the DREAM system is to: serve as a tool for farmers to input and manage the data relevant to their farms, provide a discussion forum for farmers to draw support from their community, provide a messaging tool to make support from agronomists more accessible, provide farmers custom and automated suggestions from the raw data. For agronomists, the DREAM system serves as a tool to manage their work-flows such as: managing their responsible area, managing their daily plans, providing a messaging tool to easily communicate with farmers directly, and providing a visualization of the data regarding the farmers in their responsible area. Finally, DREAM serves policy makers by providing a tool to visualize the data and quantify the performance of the farmers from the entire Telangana region. \textbf{Table \ref{tab:goals}} provides an aggregate list of the specific goals that are to be accomplished by the DREAM system.

\subsection{Scope}

\begin{flushleft} 
Considering the three users in the scope of this initiative, farmers, agronomists, and policy makers, the design of the system must first consider the following phenomena to define the context in which the system will operate. 
% world phenomena description
The world phenomena specifies phenomena or attributes of the environment that merely exist. For example, WP2 in \textbf{Table \ref{tab:worldphenomena}} indicates that farmers will have issues on the farm, whether the system exists, or not.
% machine phenomena description
The machine phenomena specifies the phenomena that occur inside the system and because of the system. For example, MP5 in \textbf{Table \ref{tab:machinephenomena}} indicates that the best path connecting all the farmers in the daily plan will be calculated. This real-world event would not occur if the system did not exist. 
% shared phenomena description
The shared phenomena, however, specifies the phenomena that satisfy the descriptions for both the world and machine phenomena. For example, SP2 in \textbf{Table \ref{tab:sharedphenomena}} indicates that a farmer sends a message to the agronomist. This real-world event would still happen if the system did not exist, but due to the functionality offered by the DREAM product, this event occurs within the system.
