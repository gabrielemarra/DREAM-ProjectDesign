%%%%%%%%%%% THE PROBLEM %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The world's food supply chain is threatened by climate change and an unsustainable rate of rising population. Since the Telangana region largely participates in the world's food economy, the Telangana government is interested in pursuing initiatives aimed at mitigating the effect these issues have on their local economy. In this case, the Telangana government wants to reform the way they build their policies regarding food production. Their goal is to utilize digital public goods and community-centric approaches in order to build resiliency against these dynamic challenges by building policies that are more agile and data-driven.
