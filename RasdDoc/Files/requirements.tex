\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{flushleft}
All users will access the application with their own devices: mobile device, tablet device, or computer device. 
The farmer's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: when the farmer is submitting their data while in their fields, their device will need to have an internet connection in order to access DREAM servers.
\item Camera [optional]: farmers can submit pictures to aid their textual descriptions when posting in the discussion board or when messaging their agronomist/s. Although this is not required to use the application, it is highly recommended. 
\item GPS sensor [optional]: farmers can either enter the location for their fields manually or by allowing the application to utilize the GPS sensor from the device. 
\end{itemize}

The agronomist's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: when the agronomist is visiting farmers their device will need to have internet access in order for the agronomist to submit their reports to the DREAM servers throughout the day and to follow the navigation path calculated by DREAM.
\item GPS [optional]: since the agronomist will use a navigation plan generated by DREAM, sharing their GPS location is preferred for an optimal user experience. Without this device functionality, the agronomist will not be able to receive turn-by-turn live directions. 
\end{itemize}

The policy maker's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: in order to access the rankings and evaluations of the farmers throughout the region, internet connection is required to access the DREAM servers. 
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
This product is accessible through a mobile-friendly application. Farmers will spend the majority of their time accessing the application through a mobile device; agronomists will access the application with both a mobile device and a computer device; policy makers will access the application almost exclusively with a computer device. Due to the mix of mobile and computer devices, the web application must be suitable for both interfaces. 


\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The mobile-friendly web application will communicate with DREAM servers over an internet connection.

%\textbf{EXAMPLE:} if the system determines that precipitation levels are decreasing and enabling a water scarcity crisis, policy makers should be able to see that identify that trend in the system and this can motivate them to enforce policy such as investing in water irrigation technologies that increase efficiency and reduce water waste. Once such policies are in place, telengana policy makers can identify if the new policy mediates the water scarcity problem.
