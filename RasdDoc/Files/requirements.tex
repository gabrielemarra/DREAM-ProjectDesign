\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{flushleft}
All users will access the application with their own devices: mobile device, tablet device, or computer device.
The farmer's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: when the farmer is submitting their data while in their fields, their device will need to have an internet connection in order to access DREAM servers. In the event that an area has limited internet connection, the data will be temporarily saved locally on the user's device. The size of the data should be negligible with respect to the memory offered by commonly held devices.
\item Camera [optional]: farmers can submit pictures to aid their textual descriptions when posting in the discussion board or when messaging an agronomist. Although this is not required to use the application, it is highly recommended.
\item GPS sensor [optional]: farmers can either manually enter their location or allow the application to utilize the GPS sensor from their device.
\end{itemize}

The agronomist's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: when the agronomist is visiting farmers their device will need to have internet access in order for the agronomist to submit their reports to the DREAM servers throughout the day and to follow the navigation path calculated by DREAM.
\item GPS [optional]: since the agronomist will use a navigation plan generated by DREAM, sharing their GPS location is preferred for an optimal user experience. Without this device functionality, the agronomist will not be able to receive live turn-by-turn navigation guidance.
\end{itemize}

The policy maker's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: in order to access the rankings and evaluations of the farmers throughout the region, internet connection is required to access the DREAM servers.
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
This product is accessible through a mobile-friendly application. Farmers will spend the majority of their time accessing the application through a mobile device; agronomists will access the application with both a mobile device and a computer device; policy makers will access the application almost exclusively with a computer device. Due to the mix of mobile and computer devices, the web application must be suitable for both interfaces.


\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The mobile-friendly web application will communicate with DREAM servers over an internet connection.

\subsection{Sequence Diagrams}

\subsubsection{Farmer}

\begin{flushleft}
As demonstrated in the sequence diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:farmerSeqRequest}}, when the farmer user access the â€œAsk Experts" area in the application, the farmer will send a request for help to their assigned agronomist in the form of a message. The agronomist and the farmer can continue to exchange messages until either user chooses to end the conversation.

%
%\textbf{EXAMPLE:} if the system determines that precipitation levels are decreasing and enabling a water scarcity crisis, policy makers should be able to see that identify that trend in the system and this can motivate them to enforce policy such as investing in water irrigation technologies that increase efficiency and reduce water waste. Once such policies are in place, Telangana policy makers can identify if the new policy mediates the water scarcity problem.

The sequence diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:farmerSeqNewThread}} shows the exchange of information between the user and the DREAM application when the farmer user creates a new thread. After the user publishes the new thread, the DREAM application saves the submitted form and updates its servers.

\begin{flushleft}
The sequence diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:farmerSeqNewField}} shows how the farmer user interacts with the DREAM application when adding a new field to their farm. Part of adding a new field to their farm involves providing the GPS location (if the user chooses to consent the DREAM application to access their location) and entering some information about the field such as the crop planted and the fertilizer used. After submitting the necessary information, the DREAM application saves and updated its servers and the farmer can then view the new field in their "My Farm" interface.

\begin{flushleft}
The sequence diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:agrSeqCreatePlan}}shows how the agronomist user interacts with the DREAM servers when creating a new daily plan in the daily plan interface including some of the specific calls that occur between the DREAM servers and the user's device. As the agronomist modifies the list of farmers to visit for the day, the agronomist's map is updated to show the new navigation path. From the list of farmers to visit, the agronomist can include or remove each farmer from the plan. Then, at the end, the agronomist can confirm the daily plan and the data is updated on the DREAM servers.

\begin{flushleft}
At the end of a agronomist's day of visiting farmers, the agronomist has to confirm the execution of the plan. \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:agrSeqConfirmPlan}} shows how the agronomist user interacts with the DREAM servers when confirming a daily plan. Confirmation of a daily plan should occur after the agronomist has completed all the farmers they intend to visit that day. When confirming, the agronomist can modify the plan so that the plan accurately reflects the visits that the agronomist actually completed that day.

Thee sequence diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:agrSeqSendReport}} shows the interaction between the agronomist user and the DREAM servers when submitting a report evaluating the status of a farmer during a visit.
\end{flushleft}


\newpage
\subsubsection{Policy Maker}


\begin{flushleft}
The policy maker's use cases revolve around examining the results of the data analysis from a holistic point of view. The sequence diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:policySeqSetFlag}} shows how the policy maker user interacts with the DREAM servers when they set a flag on a farmer. After the policy maker flags a farmer from the ranking list view, the DREAM servers save the flag and send the policy maker user a confirmation that the flag has been set.
\end{flushleft}

\end{figure}



\begin{flushleft}
The sequence diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:policySeqSetTrig}} shows how the policy maker user interacts with the DREAM servers when setting a trigger. Once the trigger parameters are set by the policy maker user, the DREAM servers saves them and confirms them with the user. Then, the data that the farmer enters thereafter is checked against the triggers saves on the DREAM servers. If the data entered satisfies a trigger, a notification is sent to the policy maker users.

\begin{flushleft}
The sequence diagram in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:policySeqViewRank}} shows the simple interaction between the policy maker user and the DREAM servers when the policy maker navigates to a ranking view. According to this sequence diagram, the ranking is calculated when the policy maker requests the view. This way, the view considers the most up-to-date data when ranking the farmers. The policy maker can also filter their view such as only considering corn farmers or only considering farmers from specific subareas.

\newpage
\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\begin{flushleft}

The DREAM application is expected to be accessed by users in the Telangana region. The servers should support over 1000 users simultaneously. The large majority of users will be farmers, whereas the number of policy makers and agronomists is strictly the number of government employees that anticipate utilizing DREAM as a tool to manage their job responsibilities. Farmers are expected to interact with the system while managing their fields in the day and agronomists and policy makers are expected to interact with the system strictly during business hours. From around 6:00 to 18:00 DREAM servers should sustain simultaneous requests from multiple users. Due to the large amount of data handled by the system it is crucial to ensure that data loss is minimal in order to preserve the integrity of the results of the data analysis produced by the system. For this reason, data integrity is prioritized over response time.\\
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Design Constraints}


\subsubsection{Standards compliance}\label{standards}
DREAM application should be as safe and secure as possible: the users and their data must be protected.\\
The system should be compliant with the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard. This standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system within the context of the organization.
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}

Since DREAM will be accessed from a mobile-friendly web application, there are few hardware limitations to consider. Instead, the limitations outlined will be easily met with common devices that are probably already used by the users.\smallskip\\
Policy makers already utilize a desktop computer for their work so with respect to the DREAM system they would need a screen that is large enough to comfortably view and configure the data visualizations offered by the DREAM application. Since DREAM will be accessed from a web application, the policy maker will need a modern internet browser; the operating system of the computer does not matter.\smallskip\\
Agronomists and farmers both may access the DREAM application from a mobile or tablet device. Current iOS/Android devices already come with GPS antennas, internet connectivity, and cameras, therefore no additional limitations need to be considered. Devices without a GPS antenna and without a camera can still be used to access the DREAM system but the user experience will be somewhat compromised: users will have to manually enter location information; users will not have turn-by-turn navigation guidance; and users will not be able to include pictures when describing issues or updates in their reports, forum posts, or help requests.\smallskip\\
Regarding the back-end, the system needs a server with constant internet access that can host the web application. A virtual machine on a cloud service, such as AWS or Azure, is a suitable solution to host the web application.\\

\subsubsection{Any other constraints}
\begin{flushleft}
Since users will have access to data visualizations, the interface should be simple enough as to no overwhelm the user but also ensure that the user has access to all the features, tools, and options when configuring their data views. Additionally, the format offered for farmers to report their data must be defined well enough so that DREAM can effectively parse through it and generate solutions with data analysis but also be flexible enough for farmers to capture qualitative data.
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Reliability}
\begin{flushleft}
Since one of DREAM's primary value-add as a product is the data analysis, preserving the data is very important. In order to recover from potential data loss, offline data backups that are updated weekly are needed for redundancy. Ideally, the DREAM system should have the highest MTTF and the lowest MTTR as possible. However, since DREAM is not dealing with time-critical features, the system can afford a higher MTTR if pending data can be saved on the user's local device while waiting for DREAM system to recover.
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Availability}
\begin{flushleft}

Since users depend on DREAM as a tool to execute their work, it is crucial to ensure the system is characterized by an availability of at least 99.9\%. This translates to about 10 minutes of downtime per week. This is tolerable because the system will be used primary during business hours and will have reduced usage or traffic during the weekends; policy makers and agronomists will likely not be accessing the DREAM application during the weekend but farmers might access the DREAM application.\smallskip\\
As mentioned, if users try to send data to the DREAM servers when they are unavailable, the data should get saved on the user's device until communication can be reestablished with the DREAM servers. Although this time duration may be perceivable to the end-user, the downtime does not interrupt the user experience since the system will handle the delayed communication. This mitigation technique ensures that the DREAM servers still receive all the data sent to it and the user's experience is not severely interrupted.\\ 
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Security}
\begin{flushleft}
Government employees will be accessing the DREAM application with sensitive credentials. Additionally, the data produced by farmer users is associated with sensitive location data. The data around the daily plans for the agronomists contains location-identifying information during an agronomist's work day. Primarily due to these reasons, security should be prioritized in the design of the DREAM system to safeguard from data leaks, exploits, and malicious users.\smallskip\\
User credentials should be hashed and encrypted. Transactions, especially those involved with sensitive location data such as the daily plans or field GPS information, should only occur through connections that are secure and encrypted through the most updated version of TLS protocol. This minimizes the risk of data breaches.
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
\begin{flushleft}
During the design, maintainability can only be sustained if good design, documentation, and coding practices are followed. Proper adherence to the standards cited in Section \ref{standards} will also preserve maintainability in the design of the system. Ensuring that the system is designed for maintainability will also enable the system to be easily scaleable; either to more farmers in the region, to other regions in India, or to other nations who wish to use DREAM.
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Portability}
\begin{flushleft}
DREAM's web application should be compatible with a variety of operating systems, both mobile and non-mobile. Since DREAM is serving a market with a wide range of access to devices (from self-funded farmers to government-funded entities), DREAM system and layout should accommodate mobile users with a modern web browser, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Similarly, for users accessing DREAM from a computer, the OS must support a web browser, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, in order to access the web application.
\end{flushleft}
