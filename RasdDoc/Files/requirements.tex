\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{flushleft}
All users will access the application with their own devices: mobile device, tablet device, or computer device. 
The farmer's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: when the farmer is submitting their data while in their fields, their device will need to have an internet connection in order to access DREAM servers.
\item Camera [optional]: farmers can submit pictures to aid their textual descriptions when posting in the discussion board or when messaging their agronomist/s. Although this is not required to use the application, it is highly recommended. 
\item GPS sensor [optional]: farmers can either enter the location for their fields manually or by allowing the application to utilize the GPS sensor from the device. 
\end{itemize}

The agronomist's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: when the agronomist is visiting farmers their device will need to have internet access in order for the agronomist to submit their reports to the DREAM servers throughout the day and to follow the navigation path calculated by DREAM.
\item GPS [optional]: since the agronomist will use a navigation plan generated by DREAM, sharing their GPS location is preferred for an optimal user experience. Without this device functionality, the agronomist will not be able to receive turn-by-turn live directions. 
\end{itemize}

The policy maker's device needs the following in order to have full functionality of DREAM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet connection [required]: in order to access the rankings and evaluations of the farmers throughout the region, internet connection is required to access the DREAM servers. 
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
This product is accessible through a mobile-friendly application. Farmers will spend the majority of their time accessing the application through a mobile device; agronomists will access the application with both a mobile device and a computer device; policy makers will access the application almost exclusively with a computer device. Due to the mix of mobile and computer devices, the web application must be suitable for both interfaces. 


\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The mobile-friendly web application will communicate with DREAM servers over an internet connection.

\subsection{Sequence Diagrams}

\subsubsection{Farmer}

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Files/sequence_disgrams/thePNGs/farmer_askExperts.png}
\caption{\label{fig:farmerSeqRequest}Sequence Diagram for Farmer.}
\end{figure}

\begin{flushleft}
As demonstrated in the sequence diagram, when the farmer user access the "Ask Experts" area in the application, the farmer will send a request for help to their assigned agronomist in the form of a message. The agronomist and the farmer can continue to exchange messages until either user chooses to end the conversation.
\end{flushleft}



\begin{figure}[hbt!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Files/sequence_disgrams/thePNGs/farmer_createThread.png}\\
\caption{\label{tab:farmerSeqNewThread}Sequence Diagram for Farmer.}
\end{figure}

\begin{flushleft}
This sequence diagram shows the exchange of information between the user and the DREAM application when the farmer user creates a new thread. After the user publishes the new thread, the DREAM application has to save the submitted form and update its servers.
\end{flushleft}


\begin{figure}[hbt!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Files/sequence_disgrams/thePNGs/farmer_newField.png}\\
\caption{\label{tab:farmerSeqNewField}Sequence Diagram for Farmer.}
\end{figure}

\begin{flushleft}
This sequence diagram shows how the farmer user interacts with the DREAMs application when adding a new field to their farm. Part of adding a new field to their farm involves providing the GPS location (if the user chooses to consent the DREAM application to access their location) and entering some information about the field such as the crop planted and the fertilizer used. After submitting the necessary information, the DREAM application saves and updated its servers and the farmer can then view the new field in their "My Fields" interface. 
\end{flushleft}



\subsubsection{Agronomist}

\end{figure}

\begin{flushleft}
This sequence diagram shows how the agronomist user interacts with the DREAM servers when modifying the area that they are responsible of with a map display interface. 
\end{flushleft}


\begin{figure}[hbt!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Files/sequence_disgrams/thePNGs/agronomist_createPlan.png}\\
\caption{\label{fig:agrSeqCreatePlan}Sequence Diagram for Agronomist.}
\end{figure}
\begin{flushleft}
This sequence diagram shows how the agronomist user interacts with the DREAM servers when creating a new daily plan in the daily plan interface including some of the specific calls that occur between the DREAM servers and the user's device. As the agronomist modifying the list of farmers to visit for the day, the agronomist's map is updated to show the new navigation path. From the list of farmers to visit, the agronomist can confirm or cancel /remove each farmer from the plan. Then, at the end, the agronomist can confirm the daily plan and the data is updated on the DREAM servers. 
\end{flushleft}

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Files/sequence_disgrams/thePNGs/agronomist_confirmPlan.png}\\
\caption{\label{fig:agrSeqConfirmPlan}Sequence Diagram for Agronomist.}
\end{figure}

\begin{flushleft}
This sequence diagram shows how the agronomist user interacts with the DREAM servers when confirming a daily plan. Confirmation of a daily plan should occur after the agronomist has completed all the farmers they intend to visit that day. When confirming, the agronomist can modify the plan so that the plan accurately reflects the visits that the agronomist actually completed that day.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
- many users
- expected widespread use among farmer population
-policy makers are not many, about 100 users
- main thing will be the amount of data to handle
- 


\subsection{Design Constraints}




\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
-security?
-geolocation?
-government 
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
- for the policy makers, thier screen must be sufficient to generate good and accurate visutalizations of the data
- gps sensors on devices are not required because users can enter location data manually but it would 1) make for a more seamless user expereince and 2) more convenient for the user
- cameras are not required but definitely can be helpful and effective when farmers communicate their issues in their requests for help
- need good internet connects so devices must be somewhat current 
- 

\subsubsection{Any other constraints}
since we are going to be working with alot of data, the interface should be simple enough as to not overwhelm the user but also ensure that the user has access to all the feature, tools, and configurations (ie, policy makers and agronomists configuring ranking views, or farmers providing qualitative data. 



\subsubsection{Reliability}
- data backups 


mtbf: mean time between failure
mttf: mean time to failure
mttr: mean time to recover
\subsubsection{Availability}
policy makers will work exclusively during buisness hours: access to DREAM servers msut be available
agronomists will also work during business hours so this is also just dream servers
farmers may have extended hours but suggestions (access to external db generated by agronomists can be made; also a possibility: farmers can complete their data entry while physically in their fields but then the app submits their data when they get stable internet connection

also access to a db can be done during evenings. off hours when traffic across the DREAM servers is low to distribute strain on the system
\subsubsection{Security}

log in credentials may be extra sensitive because some users are government employees
farmer data is senstive, because 1) their livelihood and 2) address information
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
scalability as data collection grows
good coding practices
adherence to standards

\subsubsection{Portability}
android devices
ios devices
web browser
