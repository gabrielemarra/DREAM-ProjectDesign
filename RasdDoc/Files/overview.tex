\subsection{Product Perspective}
Here we include scenarios and further details on the shared phenomena and a domain model (class diagrams and statecharts)


\begin{itemize}
\item
main objective of this system is to serve as an interface (intermediary?) between the farmers, agronomists, and policy makers. 
\item
intention is that this system will incorporate data-driven [blank] and include community focused [blank]? 
\item
this system will bridge the gap across these stakeholders with the goal for the telengana to to produce more effective and data-driven policies.
\item
since this is a big problem, with many involved people, people geographically spread out, etc this system provides an interface to that data can be shared and effectively used across users. 
\item
strengthen the cohesiveness of the policies generated and informed by data provided by users
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Product Functions}

\subsubsection{Data visualization for Farmers and Agronomists}
DREAMS helps the farmers to visualize and analyze data about their production: providing simple graphs and statistics to the users, the app allows them to better understand their needs.\\
In the section named "My Fields" each user can find personalized suggestions: thanks to the data provided by the farmers, DREAMS can recommend the type of crop to plant or the best fertilizer to use.\\
DREAMS also provides the users a precise and constantly updated weather forecast with an incredible level of detail.

\subsubsection{Support for farmers and discussion forums}
With DREAMS, each farmer can easily ask for help or suggestions directly from professional agronomists: inside the "Ask experts" section, the user can send messages to agronomists and obtain vital information to improve their production.\\
Another opportunity is the "Farmers Forum" where each farmer can ask for help from other farmers or read answers to already posted questions.

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\begin{flushleft}
This system expects three different types of users: farmer, agronomist, and policy maker.
\subsubsection{Farmer}
A farmer is a type of user that intends to use the DREAM system to visualize data relevant to them: for example, weather forecasts, personalized suggestions concerning specific crops to plant, or specific fertilizers to use.
Using the DREAM system, a farmer would like to ask for help and suggestions from a professional agronomist or other farmers.\\
\subsubsection{Agronomist}
An Agronomist is a type of user that intends to use the DREAM system to make their job easier. Agronomists want to: receive information about requests for help from the farmers and answer to them; inspect rankings and evaluation about farmers performance; have a tool for the creation, modification and confirmation of daily plan for farms' visits.
\subsubsection{Policy Maker}
A Telangana policy maker is a type of user that intends to use the DREAM system to drive policy decisions. Policy makers are mainly interested in accessing rankings and evaluations of all the farmers in the entire area as well as identifying broader trends in the data such as relating the community-provided support to production outcomes. Since policy makers have a more holistic view of the region, they use the DREAM system to configure metrics that are used to classify "well-performing" and "poor-performing" farmers based on rankings, evaluations, and data.\\
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%mainly interested in seeing the evaluations generated by the system
%\item 
%may configure the metric to classify “well-performing” and “bad-performing” farmers based on rankings generated by system, evaluations from data, and natural/ climate circumstances specific to the year 
%\item
%will use the results seen on DREAM system to make policy decisions. These policy decisions exists outside of the system but will eventually affect the farmers and their production therefore may have an indirect after-effect on the data later inputted into the system
%\item
%the system should provide sufficient and clear data and analysis to enable telengana policy makers to make clear determinations of the efficacy of their policy decisions.
