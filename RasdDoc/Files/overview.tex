\subsection{Product Perspective}
Here we include scenarios and further details on the shared phenomena and a domain model (class diagrams and statecharts)


\begin{itemize}
\item
main objective of this system is to serve as an interface (intermediary?) between the farmers, agronomists, and policy makers. 
\item
intention is that this system will incorporate data-driven [blank] and include community focused [blank]? 
\item
this system will bridge the gap across these stakeholders with the goal for the telengana to to produce more effective and data-driven policies.
\item
since this is a big problem, with many involved people, people geographically spread out, etc this system provides an interface to that data can be shared and effectively used across users. 
\item
strengthen the cohesiveness of the policies generated and informed by data provided by users
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Product Functions}
Here we include the most important requirements
\par
Maybe add another table here?

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\begin{flushleft}
This system expects three different types of users: farmer, agronomist, and policy maker.
\subsubsection{Farmer}
\subsubsection{Agronomist}
\subsubsection{Policy Maker}
A Telengana policy maker is a type of user that intends to use the DREAM system to drive policy decisions. Policy makers are mainly interested in accessing rankings and evaluations of all the farmers in the entire area as well as identifying broader trends in the data such as relating the community-provided support to production outcomes. Since policy makers have a more holistic view of the region, they use the DREAM system to configure metrics that are used to classify "well-performing" and "poor-performing" farmers based on rankings, evaluations, and data.\\
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%mainly interested in seeing the evaluations generated by the system
%\item 
%may configure the metric to classify “well-performing” and “bad-performing” farmers based on rankings generated by system, evaluations from data, and natural/ climate circumstances specific to the year 
%\item
%will use the results seen on DREAM system to make policy decisions. These policy decisions exists outside of the system but will eventually affect the farmers and their production therefore may have an indirect after-effect on the data later inputted into the system
%\item
%the system should provide sufficient and clear data and analysis to enable telengana policy makers to make clear determinations of the efficacy of their policy decisions.
