\subsection{Product Perspective}
Here we include scenarios and further details on the shared phenomena and a domain model (class diagrams and statecharts)


\begin{itemize}
\item
main objective of this system is to serve as an interface (intermediary?) between the farmers, agronomists, and policy makers. 
\item
intention is that this system will incorporate data-driven [blank] and include community focused [blank]? 
\item
this system will bridge the gap across these stakeholders with the goal for the telengana to to produce more effective and data-driven policies.
\item
since this is a big problem, with many involved people, people geographically spread out, etc this system provides an interface to that data can be shared and effectively used across users. 
\item
strengthen the cohesiveness of the policies generated and informed by data provided by users
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Product Functions}

\subsubsection{Data Visualization for Farmers}
\textbf{Farmers can visualize relevant data and suggestions based on their location and type of production.}
blah blah blah
\subsubsection{View Weather Forecast Data}
\textbf{Agronomists and farmers can view weather forecast data.}
\subsubsection{Enable Help Requests and Exchange of Suggestions}
\textbf{Farmers can interact with others farmers and agronomists by requesting for help and suggestions.}
\subsubsection{}
\textbf{Farmers can create discussion forums with other farmers.}
\subsubsection{Sub area?}
\textbf{Agronomists can supervise a sub-area inside the region.}
\subsubsection{View Ranking of Farmers (agronomists)}
\textbf{Agronomists can view the ranking of farmers’ performance in their specific area.}
\subsubsection{Manage Daily Plans} 
\textbf{Agronomists can visualize and update a daily plan to visit farms in their area.}
\subsubsection{Modify and Edit Daily Plans}
\textbf{Agronomists can specify the deviations from their daily plan and confirm the execution of their daily plan at the end of each day.}
\subsubsection{View Performance and Ranking of Farmers (policy makers)}
\textbf{Telengana’s policy makers can view the performance of the farmers and the ranking of the farmers.}
\subsubsection{View Efficacy of Support Provided.}
\textbf{Telengana’s policy makers can determine if support from agronomists and well-performing farmers produces significant results.}

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\begin{flushleft}
This system expects three different types of users: farmer, agronomist, and policy maker.
\subsubsection{Farmer}
\subsubsection{Agronomist}
\subsubsection{Policy Maker}
A Telengana policy maker is a type of user that intends to use the DREAM system to drive policy decisions. Policy makers are mainly interested in accessing rankings and evaluations of all the farmers in the entire area as well as identifying broader trends in the data such as relating the community-provided support to production outcomes. Since policy makers have a more holistic view of the region, they use the DREAM system to configure metrics that are used to classify "well-performing" and "poor-performing" farmers based on rankings, evaluations, and data.\\
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%mainly interested in seeing the evaluations generated by the system
%\item 
%may configure the metric to classify “well-performing” and “bad-performing” farmers based on rankings generated by system, evaluations from data, and natural/ climate circumstances specific to the year 
%\item
%will use the results seen on DREAM system to make policy decisions. These policy decisions exists outside of the system but will eventually affect the farmers and their production therefore may have an indirect after-effect on the data later inputted into the system
%\item
%the system should provide sufficient and clear data and analysis to enable telengana policy makers to make clear determinations of the efficacy of their policy decisions.
