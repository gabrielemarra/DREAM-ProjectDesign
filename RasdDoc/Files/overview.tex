%Here is the command to refer to another element (section, figure, table, ...) in the document: \emph{As discussed in Section~\ref{sect:overview} and as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:metamodel}, ...}. Here is how to introduce a bibliographic citation~\cite{DAM}. Bibliographic references should be included in a \texttt{.bib} file.

%Table generation is a bit complicated in Latex. You will soon become proficient, but to start you can rely on tools or external services. See for instance this \href{https://www.tablesgenerator.com}{https://www.tablesgenerator.com}. 


\subsection{Product Perspective}
Here we include scenarios and further details on the shared phenomena and a domain model (class diagrams and statecharts)


\begin{itemize}
\item
main objective of this system is to serve as an interface (intermediary?) between the farmers, agronomists, and policy makers. 
\item
intention is that this system will incorporate data-driven [blank] and include community focused [blank]? 
\item
this system will bridge the gap across these stakeholders with the goal for the telengana to to produce more effective and data-driven policies.
\item
since this is a big problem, with many involved people, people geographically spread out, etc this system provides an interface to that data can be shared and effectively used across users. 
\item
strengthen the cohesiveness of the policies generated and informed by data provided by users
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Product Functions}
Here we include the most important requirements
\par
Maybe add another table here?

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\begin{flushleft}

Here we include anything that is relevant to clarify their needs 
\par
Three users: farmer, agronomist, policy maker
\begin{itemize}
\item Farmer:
\item Agronomist:
\item Policy maker:
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Farmer}
\subsubsection{Agronomist}
\subsubsection{Policy Maker}

\begin{itemize}
\item
mainly interested in seeing the evaluations generated by the system
\item 
may configure the metric to classify “well-performing” and “bad-performing” farmers based on rankings generated by system, evaluations from data, and natural/ climate circumstances specific to the year 
\item
will use the results seen on DREAM system to make policy decisions. These policy decisions exists outside of the system but will eventually affect the farmers and their production therefore may have an indirect after-effect on the data later inputted into the system
\item
the system should provide sufficient and clear data and analysis to enable telengana policy makers to make clear determinations of the efficacy of their policy decisions. 
\end{itemize}


\textbf{EXAMPLE:} if the system determines that precipitation levels are decreasing and enabling a water scarcity crisis, policy makers should be able to see that identify that trend in the system and this can motivate them to enforce policy such as investing in water irrigation technologies that increase efficiency and reduce water waste. Once such policies are in place, telengana policy makers can identify if the new policy mediates the water scarcity problem. 
Scenario 1: see the ranking of all farmers and designate well-performing or poor-performing.\\

\medskip
Winston is a policy maker within the Telengana government tasked with providing a mid-season status report on the farmers’ progress. He logs into the DREAM system as a policy-affiliate and navigates to the list view of all the farmers. The landing page organizes the farmers by overall score from highest scoring to lowest scoring. Winston changes the ordering to lowest-to-highest by selecting the options from a drop down menu at the top of the window. The region has been experiencing unusually low precipitation levels in July, usually one of the rainiest months of the year. Winston reads this notification across the top of his window and closes the notification to hide the news ticker. He reconfigures his rank view to show low-to-high and filters by water usage. As he scrolls down the list, the graph at the bottom on the page highlights the subset of data points the Winston is viewing from the list.

\medskip 
Scenario 2: setting triggers/ flags to monitor water efficiency of farmers

\medskip
Scenario 3: new beta policy subsidizing a specific type of fertilizer is implemented and using triggers, policy makers can observe improving production yield trends in sub-regions where beta policy implemented
