\textbf{Scenario \addOne{usecase_counter}:} 
Caroline has a big farm in Telangana state with 50 hectares of land and different varieties of plants. Last year, during the monsoon season, her fields were flooded, and almost no plants survived. In addition, this summer, the hot temperature killed some other species.
After consulting an expert, she decided to join the DREAM initiative to ask for direct support from agronomists and to obtain some incentives from the central government.
Next year she will plant more resilient crops and take some precautions against flooding.
