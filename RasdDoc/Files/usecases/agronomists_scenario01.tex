\textbf{Scenario \addOne{usecase_counter}:} 
Schmidt is an agronomist. His job is based on knowing farmers' information and helping them to improve and solve problems. Before installing DREAM he was receiving various emails from farmers. All of them contained information about them and help or suggestion requests. He then needed to combined them with the information he provided about latest visits of their farm. Sometimes data were not in the same format and not standardized this slowed so much his work. Now with DREAM he can easily inspect all of the data in the same place, his device. Data are more readable and available. He can also now consult them in any place with an internet connection.
