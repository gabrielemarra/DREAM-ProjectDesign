\textbf{Scenario \addOne{usecase_counter}: DREAM helping drive policy decisions}\\\smallskip
The Telangana government partners with a start-up that is developing a new agriculture tool aimed at reducing the manual labor involved in cultivating castor. Jessica, a Telengana policy maker, rolls out a beta program steered by agronomists to issue this new product to various farmers across the region and observe how the product affects castor crop quality and production yields. Jessica observes that farmers participating in the beta program are generating much greater production yields compared to farmers not in the beta program. The increased production yields qualifies the program to get rolled out to the rest of the region. Jess uses the percent-increase data to determine how much the Telangana government can subsidize the cost of the tool.
