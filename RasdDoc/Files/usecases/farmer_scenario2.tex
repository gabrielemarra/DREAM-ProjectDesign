\textbf{Scenario \addOne{usecase_counter}:} 
Caroline has a big farm in Telangana state with 50 hectares of land and different varieties of plants. Last year, during the monsoon season, her fields were flooded, and almost no plants survived. In addition, this summer, the hot temperature killed some other species.
After consulting an expert, she decided to join the DREAM initiative to ask for direct support from agronomists. Next year she will plant more resilient crops and take some precautions against flooding.
Furthermore, frequently uploading info about her production, she can even monitor the overall performance of her fields and try to obtain some incentives from the central government.
