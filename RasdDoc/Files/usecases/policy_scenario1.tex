Ernie is a policy maker within the Teleagana government tasked with identifying the poor-performing farmers in the region. This year, a popular fertilizer manufacturer called NaturGrow slightly changed their formula. Aware of this, Ernie uses the DREAM system to view the ranking of all the farmers in the region and compare rankings by the type of fertilizer each farmer uses. Ernie observes that farmers using the new formula of NaturGrow observed a greater increased their yields compared to the other farmers. Ernie uses this information to flag the farmers did not see an increase in their yields and did not use NaturGrow's new formula.
