\textbf{Scenario :} 
Ernie is a policy maker within the Teleagana government tasked with identifying the poor-performing farmers in the region. Ernie is a liaison between the Telangana government and local suppliers for farming supplies so he is aware that this year a popular fertilizer manufacturer called NaturGrow slightly changed their formula. Ernie logs in as a policy maker and navigates to the main ranking view of all the farmers in the region. Ernie configures his view of production scores produced by DREAM to compare by type of fertilizer used. Ernie cannot see a discernible difference between the different fertilizers. Ernie then compares this view to scores from the last 5 seasons, again comparing the type of fertilizer used, and Ernie notices that farmers using the new formula of NaturGrow all increased their yields by at least 8\% whereas other farmers that did not use NaturGrow saw a change in their yields by -2 to 3\%. Ernie uses this information to flag the farmers who observed a reduction in their yields and the farmers who observed an increase in their yields of less than 8\%. In total Ernie flags 24 farmers.
