\textbf{Scenario \addOne{usecase_counter}:} 
Max is a farmer who cultivates some fields near his house in Telangana state. During the past years, he planted the same species of plants in his lands because he was scared of trying different ones with unknown needs. Now, with more children and grandchildren to feed, he would like to change the crop with something more productive. 
He heard about the DREAM initiative from a friend and, through the Association of Farmer, he got his credentials to login into the website.
Within a few minutes, he found out in the forums that there are thousands of small farmers like him with the exact doubts and fears.
He learned which species are more productive and asked advice from some agronomists.
Now he can feed his entire family and even sell some food to the local market.
