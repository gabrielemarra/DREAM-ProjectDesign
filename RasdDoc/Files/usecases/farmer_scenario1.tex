\textbf{Scenario \addOne{usecase_counter}:} 
Max is a farmer who cultivates some fields near his house in Telangana state. Max has been planting the same plant species over the last few years; he refrains from trying different plants because he is unfamiliar with the cultivation methods. Now, with more children and grandchildren to feed, he would like to change the crop with something more productive. Max learned about the DREAM initiative from a friend and, through the Association of Farmers, he received his credentials to log into the website.
Within minutes of accessing the site, he skimmed through the discussion forums and discovered that there are thousands of small farmers like him with the same doubts and fears. He learned which species are more productive and which fertilizer to use. Now he can feed his entire family and even sell some food to the local market.
