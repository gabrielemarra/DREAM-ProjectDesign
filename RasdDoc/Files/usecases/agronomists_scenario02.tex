\textbf{Scenario \addOne{usecase_counter}:} 
Cece is an agronomist. Part of her job is to visit farms in the area. She has to establish a daily plan for her visits and then send all the data she collects to the Telangana authorities. The daily plan is very hard to create: she has to search for farmers that need more help than others and find an itinerary that connects all their locations. She has to mind the distance between farms and how to reach them. She installs DREAM and now her work is much easier. All of the information about location, performance, and needs is in one place. The system also recommends farmers to visit and automatically suggests a path connecting all the farms. At the end of a day of visits, she has to compile the forms about farmers' performance that are sent automatically to the Telangana authorities.
