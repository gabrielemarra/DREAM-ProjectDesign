\textbf{Scenario \addOne{usecase_counter}: Setting Triggers}\\\smallskip
Winston is a policy maker within the Telangana government tasked with providing a mid-season status report on the progress of the farmers. Winston configures his view to organize the ranking of the farmers by water usage. Winston notices a group of outliers over-consuming water but producing below-average yields. Winston sets a trigger to alert agronomists when farmers in their responsible area surpass the average water usage while yielding below-average production. This trigger classifies such farmers as "poor-performing" in the DREAM system.
