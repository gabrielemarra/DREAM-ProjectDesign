% manually flagged outliers, set trigger to flag future dilenquient farmers
Winston is a policy maker within the Telangana government tasked with providing a mid-season status report on the progress of the farmers. Winston configures his view to organize the ranking of the farmers by water usage. Winston notices a group of outliers over-consuming water but producing below-average yields. Winston sets a trigger flag farmers that surpass the average water usage while yielding below-average production. The flagged farmers have increased priority in the queue for recommended farmers to visit on the agronomist interface.
