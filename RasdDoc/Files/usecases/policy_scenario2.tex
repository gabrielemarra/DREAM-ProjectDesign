\textbf{Scenario 2:} 
Winston is a policy maker within the Telangana government tasked with providing a mid-season status report on the progress of the farmers. He logs into the DREAM system as a policy-affiliate and navigates to the list view of all the farmers. The landing page organizes the farmers by overall score from highest scoring to lowest scoring. Winston changes the ordering to lowest-to-highest by selecting the options from a drop down menu at the top of the window. The region has been experiencing unusually low precipitation levels in July, usually one of the rainiest months of the year. Winston reads this notification across the top of his window and closes the notification to hide the news ticker. He re-configures his rank view to show low-to-high and filters by water usage. As he scrolls down the list, the graph at the bottom on the page highlights the farmers that Winston's window is focused on [better worded?]. Winston notices that there are a cluster of outliers: farmers that have exceptionally low scores below 50, about 30 points below the average score of all the farmers in the region, yet have consumed the average amount of water. Winston sets a trigger to notify him when farmers receive a score less than 20 points below the average combined with a water usage equal to or greater than the average.
