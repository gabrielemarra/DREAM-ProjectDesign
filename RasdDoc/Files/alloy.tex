\subsection{Overview}
\begin{flushleft}
This section contains a formal model describing the core parts of the system. The model was defined using Alloy, an open-source language and analyzer for software modeling.\\
The purpose of this section is to validate the consistency of the world generated by the union of the previous assumptions and requirements.\smallskip\\

The formal model shows that the system described in the present document is consistent with respect to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the utilization of the Farmers' Forum.
	\item the send of request from a Farmer to an Agronomist.
	\item the creation and confirmation of an agronomist plan.
\end{itemize}

In order to improve readability, we have introduced some minor assumption:
TODO
